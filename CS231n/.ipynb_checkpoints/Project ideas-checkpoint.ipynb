    "So it seems to me that there are three main network types of interest, ones that have shown great results in the last few years: deep Q networks, convolutional networks and recurrent networks. \n",

    "* Make a CNN\n",
    "    * What other data has similar structure to images? \n",
    "* Make a RNN\n",
    "    * RNNs are good at learning sequences (reference/reason/justification). What other sequences would be interesting to learn? Movements and actions, proofs, ... (more abstractly, anything that can be described with language?)\n",
    "    * RNN with perfect memory (as oscillations) - bohmian mechanics abstraction\n",
    "    * \n",
    "* Make a R-CNN or C-RNN?\n",
    "* Pick a game and learn it with a DQN\n",

    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, I want to know what the network is doing, I want to understand how the network is solving the given problem. So, what are the analysis tools that I need? \n",
