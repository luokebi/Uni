### Equivalence classes
$
x \sim y \\
[x] = [y] \\
[x] \cap [y] \ne \emptyset \\
$

this doesnt quite make sense to me, shouldn't it be a stronger condition? I thought that $[x] \cap [y] \ne \emptyset  =  [x] = [y]$ ???

$
a \in R, b \in R

If $[a] = \{ x \in X \mid a \sim x \} = [x_i]$ ??
If $ [x_{1},x_{55},x_{102}] = \{ x \in X \mid a \sim x \}$ is it possible for $ \{ x \in X \mid b \sim x \} = [x_{55}]$ or must it be the full equivalence class as $a == b$?

# Prediction and learning

* The rate of learning is important. The resource we are tracking is mistakes. E.g. polynomial time algorithms, sub linear error!
* Computational complexity. Want is the minimum amount of errors that you have to make to learn a given data set.
* Experts = bandit (but with less info?) - partial information (like reinformcement learning)
  * Bandit, you have to explore.
* Upper connfidence bound (or UC tree) leads to? -> monte carlo tree search
