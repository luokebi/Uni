Why define a state and internal variables seperately? 
* This shit seems important! Very similar to how quantum computers are supposed to work?
 * Could I implement something like Shors algorithm on one??? That sounds like an interesting project.
* To - do. Simulate the dynamical equations for a 1, 2/3 memprocessor system.
