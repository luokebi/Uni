# Prediction and learning

The rate of learning is important. The resource we are tracking is mistakes. E.g. polynomial time algorithms, sub linear error!

Computational complexity. Want is the minimum amount of errors that you have to make to learn a given data set.

Experts = bandit (but with less info?) - partial information (like reinformcement learning)
Bandit, you have to explore.

Upper connfidence bound (or UC tree) leads to? -> monte carlo tree search
